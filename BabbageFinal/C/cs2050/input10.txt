Dear Mr. Guilliams:

You can reach me at (314)-555-5555 tomorrow. I need
to ask you about the CS1050 and CS2050 classes. If this
does not work, we can reschedule for 04-19-2013 which is
this Friday. You can ask Johnny for details if needed.

I also wanted to double check with you about Jim's phone number.

I have it in my phone right now as (816)-555-4070 but the name
says Jim Batman but that can't be right. I need his EE2100 notes.
I missed class on 02-31-2012 (last week).

Thanks,

Joe Sixpack
