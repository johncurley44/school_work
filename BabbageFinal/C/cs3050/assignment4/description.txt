This algorithm was implemented using the Bellman-Ford algorithm as its basis. However, a modification had to be made because the 
Bellman-Ford algorithm is for use with a single-source, but our problem does not indicate one. To fix this issue, the distances of 
every vertex is initialized as 0 instead of a very large number (infinity). This allows the algorithm to use any potential source and 
still determine whether or not a NWC exists. 

To increase the efficiency of the algorithm, each vertex was saved to a queue whenever it's distance was changed by the algorithm. 
Then, when going through the algorithm again, only the changed vertices and their adjacent vertices are examined, for those are the 
only ones that can be a part of the shortest path. (Any segment of a shortest path is a shortest path.) This noticably increased 
the runtime of the algorithm and its overall efficiency.
